# Grid Testing

---

This directory contains tests for the grid functionality of the `grids` package.
Each test is designed to validate specific aspects of grid creation, manipulation, and rendering.

The following testing files are present:

- `test_grid_creation.py`: Tests building each type of grid from scratch
  with a specific generator method.
- `test_grid_io.py`: These are tests which check that grids can be written
  to disk and successfully read back in.
